## **Summary** 

This script can be used universally for future elections and voting by simply making a few modifications. It can be used for larger, federal elections by substituting States for Counties. It can also used for smaller-scale town hall meetings, where there is only a yea or nay vote. To accomplish this "yea or nay" should be used in place of the "candidates".
